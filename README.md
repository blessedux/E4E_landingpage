# 🪙 E4E: Equity For Everyone

**Tagline:** Own the future, one startup at a time.

## Overview

E4E is a decentralized micro-investment platform that lets anyone invest in early-stage startups starting from $50. It breaks the traditional barriers of venture capital — no suits, no gatekeepers — allowing communities to back founders they believe in.

## Mission

To make ownership accessible to everyone, not just accredited investors or insiders. We believe that equity — not salary — is the real path to freedom.

## How It Works

- **Swipe to Discover:** Browse real founders and their startups
- **Invest from $50:** Join others in co-owning the future
- **Milestone Locks:** Funds are released only when founders hit verifiable milestones
- **Fair & Transparent:** Every investment is tracked on-chain for full accountability

## Values

- **Fairness:** The game was never fair — we're changing that
- **Transparency:** Trust is built through verifiable progress
- **Community:** Ownership thrives when shared
- **Freedom:** Because financial independence should be for everyone

## Call to Action
